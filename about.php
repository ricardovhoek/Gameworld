        <h1>About</h1>
      I threw a wish in the well
      Don't ask me, I'll never tell
      I looked to you as it fell
      And now you're in my way
      I trade my soul for a wish
      Pennies and dimes for a kiss
      I wasn't looking for this
      But now you're in my way<br>

      Your stare was holding
      Ripped jeans, skin was showing
      Hot night, wind was blowing
      Where you think you're going, baby?<br>

      Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
      But here's my number, so call me maybe
      It's hard to look right at you, baby
      But here's my number, so call me maybe
      Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
      But here's my number, so call me maybe
      And all the other boys try to chase me
      But here's my number, so call me maybe<br>

      You took your time with the call
      I took no time with the fall
      You gave me nothing at all
      But still you're in my way
      I beg and borrow and steal
      At first sight and it's real
      I didn't know I would feel it
      But it's in my way<br>

      Your stare was holding

      Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
      I missed you so bad
      I missed you so, so bad
      Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
      And you should know that
      I missed you so, so bad<br>

      It's hard to look right at you, baby
